TODO

- docs
- select2
- pickadate
- check out form.css
- readonly templates changes
- horizontal/inline forms + structural things
- tinymce label/help text have strange positions
- autocomplete input text has some UI fail
- UX of sequence remove button sux
- multiple_error_messages_seq/ - doesn't display sequence items on error
- date parts widget - currently it's inline as a whole, see custom_classes_on_outermost_html_element for demo
- if errors are not on first displayed tabs for mappings, we have to let the user know where they are, see edit/ for demo
- run all tests
- doesn't star mean required?

borken tests:

- readonly_sequence_of_mappings - totally broken layout
- deferred_schema_bindings/ - due to date widget

MIGRATION NOTES: 

- removed deprecated `height, width, skin, theme` parameters from RichTextWidget
- removed deprecated `render_initial_item` from SequenceWidget
- removed deprecated deform.Set (use colander.Set instead)
- DateInputWidget renamed parameter `dateFormat` to `format`
- merged TypeaheadInputWidget to AutocompleteInputWidget (removed delay parameter)
- AutocompleteInputWidget now accepts string type for "values"
- chaining schemas now means tabs are generated

OPEN QUESTIONS:

- deform 2.0 requires twitter bootstrap 3.0, should we tell users to always load basic requirements?

NICE TO HAVE

- structural widget (mapping_item.pt) - do we need that or not or what? + add a demo
- deformdemo1.repoze.org, deformdemo2.repoze.org
- prepend/append t.bootstrap stuff
- https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/116#issuecomment-23210460
- group demos by widget type
