Next release
------------

- Every form has a formid now, defaulting to ``deform``.  The formid
  is used to compute the id of the form tag as well as the button ids
  in the form.  Previously, if a formid was not passed to the Form
  constructor, no id would be given to the rendered form and the
  buttons would not be prefixed with any formid.

- Initial release.
